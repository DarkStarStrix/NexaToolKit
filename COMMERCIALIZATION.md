# Nexa ToolKit: Commercialization Strategy

This document outlines the three-tier model for distributing and commercializing the Nexa ToolKit.

## Guiding Principle

The core problem we solve is the inefficiency and unreliability of writing one-off scripts for common ML model operations. 
Our solution is a low-friction, robust, and scalable tool. The pricing and tiers are designed to make this accessible to individuals while providing a path for organizational adoption.

## Tier 1: Weekly Access

-   **Target Audience**: Individuals with short-term project needs, students, or users who want to evaluate the tool thoroughly before committing.
-   **Price**: $5 / week.
-   **Product**: A time-limited license key that unlocks the full functionality of the `nexa-toolkit.exe` application.
-   **Features**: Access to all features, identical to the Lifetime tier.
-   **Distribution**: Stripe payment link on the website, with the license key delivered via email.

## Tier 2: Lifetime Access

-   **Target Audience**: Professional developers, researchers, and hobbyists who regularly work with ML models and see long-term value in the tool.
-   **Price**: $15 one-time payment.
-   **Product**: A perpetual license key that unlocks the full functionality of the `nexa-toolkit.exe` application, including all future updates.
-   **Features**: Access to all features, identical to the Weekly tier. This is the best-value offer.
-   **Distribution**: Stripe payment link on the website, with the license key delivered via email.

## Tier 3: Enterprise & Custom

-   **Target Audience**: Organizations, MLOps teams, and companies that require more than just the standalone tool.
-   **Price**: Custom, based on consultation.
-   **Product**: This is a service-oriented tier offering tailored solutions.
-   **Offerings**:
    -   **Custom Integrations**: Professional services to integrate Nexa ToolKit into a company's existing CI/CD and MLOps pipelines.
    -   **Dedicated Support**: Priority support channels and dedicated engineering time for troubleshooting and questions.
    -   **Feature Development**: Prioritized or custom-built features to meet specific organizational needs.
    -   **Deployment Models**:
        -   **Dev Mode (Self-Hosted)**: The organization receives the source code and support to host and manage the backend on their own infrastructure for maximum control.
        -   **Managed Service**: A fully-hosted and managed backend solution for teams that want a hands-off, turnkey experience with guaranteed uptime and maintenance.
-   **Distribution**: A "Contact Us" call-to-action on the website, leading to a consultation to scope needs and provide a quote.
